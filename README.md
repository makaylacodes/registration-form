## Registration Form

I learned HTML forms by building a registration page. I learned how to control the types of data people can type into the form, and some new CSS tools for styling the page. The page is currently static so the submit button does not take the user anywhere.

This registration form requires users to enter their first name, last name, email address, and password. Next, the user must decide if they want to sign up for a personal account or a business account.

The last section of the form is completely optional. Users can add age, a bio, and a photo to their profile. Users are also encouraged to select an option telling us how they found us.
